# Guess my number
 "Guess My Number" is a simple and engaging web game where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures the game interface, including input fields for guesses and display areas for messages, scores, and the mystery number. CSS styles the page with a retro aesthetic, using the 'Press Start 2P' font and thematic color schemes. JavaScript powers the game's logic, handling user inputs, score tracking, and dynamic feedback based on guesses. The game features interactive elements like 'Check!' and 'Again!' buttons for guess submission and game reset, respectively, offering an enjoyable and replayable experience.
